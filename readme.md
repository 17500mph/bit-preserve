# Bit Preserve
Recreating classic computer schematics. Let's convert all those random scanned PDFs into a modern, editiable, and re-usable format.

Right now this repo is just a demo. Most of the directories are empty. There are unfinished schematics for the Apple IIgs. The other directories are just suggestions for other computers to document.

# How it works
tl;dr, Pick a system, find a schematic, and start drawing. The project has picked KiCad as the primary schematic capture tool. If there are variants of the schematic, give them their own directory. 

# More information
I am working on a longer description. For now, check out my slides from KiCon 2019. https://baldengineer.com/kicon2019

# Rules
* Do not upload PDFs or images of schematics. It's okay to link back to a site hosting them (I guess). The only files to be hosted here are KiCad (aka editable) files.
* Use KiCad
* Don't be a dweeb
